/**
 * Drift guard for the one place this package reads the producer's prose.
 *
 * A refused write comes back as a plain `tool_result` with no `isError`, so the
 * only thing distinguishing "the operator said no" from "it ran fine" is the
 * result text — and that text is a bare literal in
 * `backend/core/agent/src/loop.js`, not an exported constant. If it is reworded,
 * rejected writes silently start rendering with a success tick, which is exactly
 * the wrong thing to tell someone who just refused a command.
 *
 * Skipped when the backend is absent, so a standalone `ui/` checkout still passes.
