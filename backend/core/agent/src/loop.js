 *
 * It is logged here rather than left to the caller, which is the one impurity in this module and

 * the caller still held the error — and no caller logged it. A turn then failed under load with
 * "the assistant could not complete that request" on the panel, nothing in the gateway log, and no
 * way to tell a queued request from a dead provider. Every call site would have to remember; this
