/**
 * What each capability is allowed to spend on one turn.
 *
 * The capability already decides which tools are admitted. It has to decide this too, because
 * the two are the same judgement: a model trusted with harder tools is a model trusted to take
 * more steps to use them.
 *
 * A step is one model call, not one tool call — the answer costs a step of its own, as does a
 * repair after malformed JSON and an acknowledgement after a rejected write. So `small` affords
 * about five tool calls, not six. A question that fans out over the whole fleet does not fit any
 * of these numbers and belongs in a tool that fans out internally, not in a larger budget.
 *
 * `small` is a 4B — the model this agent was measured on, and the floor it is expected to run
 * against. Anything below that is not supported: the tool loop asks for JSON on demand and a
 * sub-billion model does not reliably produce it.
 *
 * maxOutputTokens rises faster than steps because a reasoning model spends this same budget on
 * its thinking before emitting a visible token, and a local model served with thinking disabled
 * spends all of it on the answer.

/**
 * How long one model call may take before the turn gives up on it.
 *
 * Nothing bounded a request until a batch run stopped dead on one that never answered — the
 * server was healthy and replying to everything else, and a single stream simply stopped. There
 * is no upper bound in the protocol, so without one here a turn can wait forever: at a CLI that
 * is a prompt that never returns, and behind a gateway it is a request handler that never
 * returns while its session stays locked mid-turn.
 *
 * Generous on purpose. A local 4B with tools answers in seconds and a hosted reasoning model
 * has been seen to take twenty-five, so two minutes never fires on a slow answer — only on one
 * that is not coming. It bounds a call, not a turn: a turn may make several.
